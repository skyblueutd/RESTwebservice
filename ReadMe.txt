keep the code structure as the same as that in the books.
There are two index.php files. Don't change the location of those two files.

http://localhost/books/ prints the JSON file of all books
http://localhost/books/id/?book_id=3 prints the indexed book info.

http://localhost/books/restclient.php is the test webpage, which gives hyperlinks to specified books.
